# ship-log
a menu to allow user to determine where the ship goes and store the log


1.	The program would allow user to enter the coordinates to look the distance between the ship and the destination or travel to the destination point. It also allows user to save and load logs and view the total distance.
2.	The user would have to enter the shipâ€™s name, and then the user could enter the coordinates. After the user entered the coordinates, he could choose to view the distance between the coordinates or goes to the coordinates point. If the user chose to go to the coordinates, after the ship travels to the destination point, the user should save the logs, so he could load the log and see where the coordinates he has been and the total destination that the ships had traveled.
